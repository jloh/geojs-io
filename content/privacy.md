 1. The Act covers personal information and sensitive information. Both of these are referred to as "information" throughout this document.

Personal information is "information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion."

Sensitive Information is information or an opinion that is personal information, and is about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual preferences, or criminal record and any health information about an individual.
