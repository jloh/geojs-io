## Domains

GeoJS is available on https://get.getjs.io/. The `HTTP` version redirects to the `HTTPS` version, as such a non-HTTPS version is not available. There is no plan to ever change this.

IPv6 and IPv4 only endpoints are available on https://ipv6.geojs.io/ and https://ipv4.geojs.io/ respectively.

## Rate Limits

As it currently stands GeoJS has no rate limits and doesn't require any to be implemented. Should rate limits be required advanced warning will be given.

## Endpoints

Currently GeoJS only has our [IP endpoint](/docs/v1/endpoints/) and our [ChatOps](/docs/v1/chatops/) integration.
